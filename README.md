# additional-aux-slot
Mod for stellaris which adds an additional aux slot to all ships. Compatible with 4.1.

Adds an additional small module to defemse platforms to boost the defense stats slightly, as the alternative would be giving every platform section +1 slot (2 bonus slots total) which didn't feel right to me.
